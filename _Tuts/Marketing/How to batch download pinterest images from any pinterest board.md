I’m using DownAlbum, previously designed to work with FB.
It’s a Chrome extension that (now) allows you to download full Pinterest albums.

It’s fast, extremely easy to use, and it’s working fine even with boards containing large amount of pics ; eg, I just ended a 500+ pins download without any issue.
It also generates an HTML file that can be used like a print/contact sheet with captions imported.

People with Pinterest download concerns should consider this extension.



I know about some really good Chrome extensions that can help you batch download images from Pinterest. All these are free extensions. Here is the list:

DownAlbum- Apart from downloading Pinterest images in batch, it can download Facebook albums, Instagram albums, Twitter photos, etc.
PinDown Free- Its free plan can help you download 250 images from a Pinterest board.
Image Downloader- This open source Chrome extension lets you batch download images from Pinterest, Reddit, and other sites.
ImageAssistant Batch Image Downloader- Also a good option to download multiple images from Pinterest.
Hope it will help you :)
