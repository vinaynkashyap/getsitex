# Git Concept

Git (Local copy) != GitHub (Git Hosting Service)

Git in simple words: Manage project files and track changes.

- Working Directory
- Staging Area
- Commit Changes

Working Directory > Add to Staging Area > Commit to Local Repo > Update Remote Repo > Checkout/Clone

Working Directory is your project folder on your local system from which you should first add the updated files to a Staging Area. 

Files added to a staging area can be now added to your local git repo using the  Commit command. Your Local Repo can be synced to a Remote Repo.

Checkout/Clone command can be used to download a remote repo to your local system.
